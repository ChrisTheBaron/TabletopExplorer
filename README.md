*Show off your carefully designed maps in all their glorious detail. You'll be
able to effortlessly tell your characters exactly how far away their next fight
is.*

*Quickly add any number of tokens to the map, saving your PC's tokens so you 
don't waste any time getting them into their next deadly encounter.*

*There's no limits to the places your characters can go, and no limits to the 
number of maps you can have. Switch back and forth with ease.*

perfectly.*
